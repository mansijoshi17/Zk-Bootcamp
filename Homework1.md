Some modular arithmetic

## Answers

**1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}**
   **What is a) 4 + 4**
           **b) 3 x 5**
           **c) what is the inverse of 3 ?**

(a). 

```
 4 + 4 = 8
 8 mod 7 = 1
 4 + 4 = 1

```

(b). 

```
 3 * 5 = 15
 15 mod 7 = 1
 3 * 5 = 1

```

(c). 

```
Number x such that 3 * x = 1 (mod 7)

In this case 3 * 5 = 1 (We can see that in above solution)

The inverse of 3 modulo 7 is 5.

**2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?** 

In order for a set S together with an operation + to form a group, the following four group must be satisfied:

S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

**1. Closure:**  For any a, b in S, the result of a + b should be in S.
        5 + 6 = 11, 11 is not in S therefore, S with + does not satisfy the closure.

**2. Associativity:** For any a, b, c in S, the result of (a + b) + c should be equals to a + (b + c).
       (2 + 3) + 1 = 2 + (3 + 1)
         6 = 6
    Therefore, S with + does satisfy the Associativity.

**3. Identity element** There exists an element e in S such that,for every element a in
S ,the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. Such an element is
unique and thus one speaks of the identity element.    
     Identity element for  + is 0. 
     0 + a = a + 0 = a
     0 + 6 = 6 + 0 = 6

**4. Inverse Element** There exists an element a • b = b • a = e,where e is the identity element.
     3 + 4 = 7
     4 + 3 = 7

  

**3. What is -13 mod 5 ?**

```
−13 mod 5 is 2

**4. Polynomials For the polynomial x^3 − x^2 + 4x − 12 Find a the positive root ? What is the degree of this polynomial ?**

(i). 



if we take x = 2

 = 2<sup>3</sup> - 2<sup>2</sup> + 4 * 2 - 12 

 = 8 - 4 + 8 - 12 

 = 0

Since x = 2 makes polynomial equal to zero, so 2 is positive root. 



(ii).

```
The degree of polynomial is the 3.
