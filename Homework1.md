Some modular arithmetic

## Questions

1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} 
   What is a) 4 + 4 
           b) 3 x 5 
           c) what is the inverse of 3 ?

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?
3. What is -13 mod 5 ?
4. Polynomials For the polynomial x^3 − x^2 + 4x − 12 Find a the positive root ? What is the degree of this polynomial ?


## Answers

1. 

(a). 

```
 4 + 4 = 8
 8 mod 7 = 1
 4 + 4 = 1

```

(b). 

```
 3 * 5 = 15
 15 mod 7 = 1
 3 * 5 = 1

```

(c). 

```
Number x such that 3 * x = 1 (mod 7)

In this case 3 * 5 = 1 (We can see that in above solution)

The inverse of 3 modulo 7 is 5.

```

2. 

3. 

−13 mod 5 is 2.

4. 

if we take x = 2
