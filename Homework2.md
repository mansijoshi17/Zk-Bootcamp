## Questions

1. Modular arithmetic - you just need to find examples, you
don't need to prove anything.
   1. Is it true that all odd squares are â‰¡ 1 (mod 8) ?
   2.  what about even squares (mod 8) ?

2. Try out the vanity bitcoin address example at asecurity
or the Ethereum version
3. What do you understand by
   1. O(n)
   2. O(1)
   3. O(log n)
For a proof size, which of these would you want ?


## Answers

**1**. 

All odd squares are congruent to 1 modulo 8: (2k + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 1 (mod 8).
All even squares are congruent to 0 modulo 8: (2k)<sup>2</sup> = 1 (mod 8).
